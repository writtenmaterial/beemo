[[{"l":"Home","p":["Are you tired of dealing with spammy userbot raids on your Discord server? Beemo might just be the solution you've been looking for! Beemo is a free antispam Discord Bot that can help you put an end to those pesky raids once and for all.","Slash commands have been added to Beemo.","First of all, it's worth noting that Beemo doesn't currently use Discord's slash commands. So, if another bot is using the slash command /help, you won't be able to type /help to use Beemo. But don't worry - we've got a temporary fix for you! Simply add a space in front of any command that might be taken by another bot's slash commands. For example, you can type space/help instead of /help.","Now, you may have noticed that the documentation for Beemo Max is a bit limited. But don't worry, we've got you covered. Since Beemo is designed to be configured in-Discord, all of the commands are generally well documented via their respective help menus. And if you still need more information or have questions, feel free to join our Discord community - we'd love to help you out!"]},{"i":"getting-started-with-beemo-easy-steps-to-set-up-and-add-to-your-server","l":"Getting Started with Beemo: Easy Steps to Set Up and Add to Your Server","p":["First things first, invite Beemo to your server. Just keep in mind that in order for Beemo to function properly, it needs to have the Ban Members permission. We also request some other permissions for logging and antispam improvements.","Once you've invited Beemo, move its highest role above regular server members so that it can ban regular members.","If you want to set up an action log for antispam, you can do that too! Just use the command /antispam log #channel.","And that's it! Beemo will now automatically check and ban any userbot raids that it detects. Please note that the algorithm is not configurable because it's designed to work dynamically. However, in the future, you'll be able to disable/enable the antispam via a command.","Beemo will only post logs to the specified channel when a raid is detected against your server. So, if you've followed the steps above, Beemo is already passively protecting your server with no other configuration required. Just remember, \"no news is good news.\"","If a raid occurs that Beemo doesn't detect, please submit a report to the #spam-reports channel on the Beemo Discord server to help improve the algorithm (and be sure to check the pins for the required format to do so!). It's important to keep in mind that Beemo's antispam is provided for free, and while we do our best to help, we can't be on-call for all of the servers."]},{"l":"Intel","p":["Website","Discord Support Server","Tiers"]}],[{"l":"Moderation"},{"i":"lets-talk-about-moderation","l":"Let's talk about moderation!","p":["At Beemo, we've got your back when it comes to handling problematic users.

They're a great feature that allows moderators like you to easily browse through a user's message history, including any edits or deleted messages.

This will grant you access to an archive that contains the user's message history from the past 3 days. Just keep in mind that manually generated archives expire 12 hours after the command execution.","Moderators or administrators cannot manually generate archives. This is to ensure that messages from private mod or admin channels are not exposed.","Automatically Generated","Whenever a moderation command is run that targets a user (such as a ban), all of the user's messages (including edits and deletions) will be archived and attached to the case. These archives serve as a snapshot of the past 3 days of a user's message history and will not expire for the purpose of moderation log persistence.","If you want to check info on a case, simply run the command /case case id or /modlogs user id and the case-specific archive links will be displayed.","One thing to keep in mind is that when a user types /mylogs, they will not see the archives for their cases."]},{"l":"Preset Reasons","p":["With Preset Reasons, you can store pre-written messages that your moderators can use when they need to take the same moderation action multiple times. This saves them from having to write out the same message every time, which can be a real time-saver!","So, next time you need to take a redundant moderation action, just select the preset reason that fits the situation and hit send. Easy, right?"]},{"l":"About","p":["With Preset Reasons, you can use pre-made flags for reasons that come up frequently, kind of like canned responses for moderators.","This feature is especially useful for those reasons that tend to come up again and again, so you don't have to type out the same thing every time."]},{"l":"Configuring Preset Reasons","p":["First, it's important to note that you'll need to have the Administrator permission or be a Moderation Manager to configure preset reasons.","To manage your presets, you can use the following commands: to set a new preset reason, just type /mod presetreason [preset name] (reason). If you want to remove a preset reason, just type /mod presetreason [preset name] without a reason.","Once you've added your preset reasons, all moderators in your server can use them by simply typing -reasonhere as their reason. It's that easy!","If you want to view all of the available preset reasons, just type /presetreasons. And if you want to see a specific reason, you can do /presetreasons -reasonhere.","Using preset reasons in moderation commands is easy too! Just put -reasonhere as your reason at the end of the moderation command, and Beemo will automatically take action with that reason. You can also use the /edit (case id) -presetreasonhere command to apply a preset reason to an existing case."]}],[{"l":"Utility"},{"l":"Utility","p":["Get the most out of our product, including integrated XP and consumable-credit role-shops based on activity (we call them honey).

The curve is determined by the formula: XP = Difficulty * (Level)(Level to XP Ratio) + 4.
