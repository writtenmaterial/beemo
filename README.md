Are you tired of dealing with spammy userbot raids on your Discord server? Beemo might just be the solution you've been looking for! Beemo is a free antispam Discord Bot that can help you put an end to those pesky raids once and for all.

!!!warning Important Note
!!!

First of all, it's worth noting that Beemo doesn't currently use Discord's slash commands. So, if another bot is using the slash command `/help`, you won't be able to type `/help` to use Beemo. But don't worry - we've got a temporary fix for you! Simply add a space in front of any command that might be taken by another bot's slash commands. For example, you can type `<space>/help` instead of `/help`.

Now, you may have noticed that the documentation for Beemo Max is a bit limited. But don't worry, we've got you covered. Since Beemo is designed to be configured in-Discord, all of the commands are generally well documented via their respective help menus. And if you still need more information or have questions, feel free to join our Discord community - we'd love to help you out!

### Getting Started with Beemo: Easy Steps to Set Up and Add to Your Server
First things first, invite Beemo to your server. Just keep in mind that in order for Beemo to function properly, it needs to have the Ban Members permission. We also request some other permissions for logging and antispam improvements.

Once you've invited Beemo, move its highest role above regular server members so that it can ban regular members.

If you want to set up an action log for antispam, you can do that too! Just use the command `/antispam log <#channel>`.

And that's it! Beemo will now automatically check and ban any userbot raids that it detects. Please note that the algorithm is not configurable because it's designed to work dynamically. However, in the future, you'll be able to disable/enable the antispam via a command.

!!! Quick note:
Beemo will only post logs to the specified channel when a raid is detected against your server. So, if you've followed the steps above, Beemo is already passively protecting your server with no other configuration required. Just remember, "no news is good news."
!!!

If a raid occurs that Beemo doesn't detect, please submit a report to the #spam-reports channel on the Beemo Discord server to help improve the algorithm (and be sure to check the pins for the required format to do so!). It's important to keep in mind that Beemo's antispam is provided for free, and while we do our best to help, we can't be on-call for all of the servers.
